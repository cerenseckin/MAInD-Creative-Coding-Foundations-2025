- Enter a Title, Artist (or any custom label), and a URL link. Click “Remember” to pin your entry.
- Each pinned item is a clickable hyperlink that opens in a new browser tab.
- The built-in color picker to personalizes each item’s appearance.

- The Erase All button clears your archive completely, giving the user a fresh start.
- The application is responsive, providing 2 different views for different devices.
